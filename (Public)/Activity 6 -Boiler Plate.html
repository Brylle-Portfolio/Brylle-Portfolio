    <p>
     I like to draw but more importantly I know different artistic styles of art from simple hand drawn, paiting sculpting,<br> 
     and weaving and I also like to play video games, and my favorate movies are adventurous. There are many <br>
     things about me that are not that interesting but who cares I'm just being my self. Just an added fact about me I <br>
     also like to play instrument like a guitar, piano, ukelele, drums, and violine.

     At very young age I went into military training by sir.James Esteban and sir.Kaji kujarack, though I as train to be heartless <br>
     I still manage to be more humble, even how many times they made me struggle in  train but I never gave up and finish my military <br>
     training and know my skills got a bit rusty still it may come in handy when the time comes.
